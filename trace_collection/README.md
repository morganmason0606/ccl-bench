# Trace collection
Trace collection: Eric

On github this folder should only store the metadata, i.e. workload card.

You are going to upload your traces to Canvas. 

Sample traces are stored in the [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1shHsa3WvlGh9YRaX7iqYBYTLnwdDfLX6)

## Current list of traces
1. `llama3.1-8b-torchtitan-perlmutter`
2. `deepseekv2lite-vllm-lambda1`
